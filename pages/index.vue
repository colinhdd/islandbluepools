      Island Blue Pools

Our vision is to provide a platform for every Jamaican to learn how to swim. Approximately 15%
of Jamaicans can swim, which is a relatively small number for a country surrounded by water. The
team at Island Blue Pools is focused on changing this statistic, and believe the quality of our
instruction, affordability and passion for swimming will drive us forward to achieve our vision.
